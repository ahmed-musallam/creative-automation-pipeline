# Assignment Requirements & Constraints

## Assignment Overview

- **Type**: FDE Take-Home Exercise
- **Duration**: 3-4 hours implementation + 30-minute presentation
- **Client**: Global consumer goods company launching hundreds of localized social ad campaigns monthly

## Core Business Objectives

1. **Accelerate campaign velocity** - Rapid ideation, production, approval, and launch
2. **Ensure brand consistency** - Maintain global brand guidelines across markets
3. **Maximize relevance & personalization** - Adapt to local cultures and preferences
4. **Optimize marketing ROI** - Improve performance vs. cost and efficiency
5. **Gain actionable insights** - Track effectiveness at scale

## Technical Requirements (Minimum)

### Must implement

- Goal: A working PoC that automates creative asset generation for social ad campaigns using GenAI.
- Input brief: Accept a brief YAML containing:
  - products (≥2)
  - target region/market
  - target audience
  - campaign message.
- Asset reuse: Read input assets from a local folder (or mock storage) and reuse when available.
- Backfill via GenAI: If required assets are missing, generate them with a GenAI image model.
- Renditions: Produce creatives in at least three aspect ratios (e.g., 1:1, 9:16, 16:9). required resolutions:
  - 1080x1080 (1:1 square)
  - 1920x1080 (16:9 landscape)
  - 1080x1920 (9:16 portrait)
- Local run: Implement as a local command-line tool or simple local app (language/framework is your choice).
- Output structure: Save outputs to a folder, clearly organized by product and aspect ratio.
- Documentation: Include a README that explains how to run, example input/output, key design decisions, and assumptions/limitations.

## Nice to Have Features

- Localization: Provide localized message support (if possible).
- Brand checks: Basic brand compliance (e.g., logo presence, brand colors).
- Legal checks: Simple content checks (e.g., prohibited words).
- Logging/reporting: Emit logs or a simple results report.
- That’s the whole spec for Task 2, scoped to what you need to build and ship locally

## Implementation Details

- build the app as a functional typescript API.
- expose the API via a simple CLI that accepts the YAML, parses it, passes it to the functional TS API.

## Architecture Components

- Asset ingestion system
- Storage management (Azure/AWS/Dropbox)
- GenAI-based asset generation
- Agentic monitoring system
- Stakeholder communication system

## Stakeholders

- Creative Lead
- Ad Operations
- IT
- Legal/Compliance

## Success Criteria

- Working proof-of-concept
- Clear technical approach
- Problem-solving demonstration
- Creative technology integration
- Comprehensive documentation
- Professional presentation readiness

## Technical Constraints

- Must run locally
- Handle hundreds of campaigns efficiently
- Support multiple products and regions
- Generate assets for 3+ aspect ratios
- Demonstrate scalability and maintainability

## Key Clarifications & Requirements

### GenAI Provider

- **Firefly Services (FFS)**: Recommended for internal applicants, not mandatory
- Can use mixed approach with other models
- Focus on one provider for POC (abstraction possible but not required)
- Internal FFS access: https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/GenAI/Firefly+Services+Internal+Access

### Output Specifications

- **Resolutions**: Common social media formats
  - 1080x1080 (1:1)
  - 1920x1080 (16:9)
  - 1080x1920 (9:16)
- **Formats**: JPEG/PNG/SVG (choose what makes sense for your solution)

### Input Assets

- **Types**: Logos, product shots, pre-generated creatives
- **Purpose**: Handle generation, resizing, localization, recomposition
- **Brand compliance and legal checks are plus features**

### Architecture Evaluation Criteria

- **Completeness of CSC (Creative Services Cloud)** at general level
- **Content creation & production** with GenAI/Firefly components
- **Cloud provider**: Generic approach preferred (mix of Adobe and 3rd party)
- **Key challenges**: Scalability, cost, hallucination handling, brand compliance

### Task 3 - Agentic System Design

- **Diversity**: Based on brand guidelines, focus on agent design (not creative diversity)
- **"Insufficient assets"**: Refers to missing background assets, patterns, logos needed for generation
- **Threshold**: Based on brand guidelines (e.g., X number of social formats per campaign)
- **Stakeholder communication**: Direct email from you, not from the agent
